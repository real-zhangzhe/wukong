# Wukong for large-scale recommendation

Unofficial implementation of the paper [Wukong: Towards a Scaling Law for Large-Scale Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02545) from Meta.

It presents a novel state-of-the-art architecture for recommendation systems that additionally follows a similar scaling law of large language models, where the model performance seems to increase with respect to the model scale without a clear asymptote on the scales explored in the paper.

This repository contains implementations for both Pytorch and Tensoflow.
